## BLE_ESP_IDF

# Problem Statement:-

# TODO: 
Write a code for the Dev. board that you choose to broadcast bluetooth services. (not a beacon)

# Services to broadcast:
1. Temperature Measurement
2. Humidity
(Either interface the sensor with the development board or just write a function that mimic the sensor behaviour in code)
