# BLE_ESP_IDF

# Problem Statement:-

## To Do: 
### Write a code for the Development Board (ESP32 or Arduino board with bluetooth on it) that you choose to broadcast bluetooth services. (not a beacon)

## Services to broadcast:
1. Temperature Measurement
2. Humidity

(Either interface the sensor with the development board or just write a function that mimic the sensor behaviour in code)

## Details about service to broadcast over bluetooth
  • Service UUID: 00000002-0000-0000-FDFD-FDFDFDFDFDFD 
  • Characteristics:
    ◦ Temperature Measurement 
    ◦ Humidity
